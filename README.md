# SpatialRepresentations

Project based on https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627320304682.

To install dependencies : 
```bash
conda env update -f environment.yml
```

To train an agent start train.py (you can modify the network in the file) and to plot the figures start analysis.py (don't forget to update ppoagent.py to the desired network). I only added the RNN checkpoint because the LSTM one was too big. If you want to try the LSTM you can send me a mail or train one yourself.
